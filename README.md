# Engodo üé£
>
>WIP: This repository is a work in progress and is not yet ready for production use.

Welcome to **Engodo**! This repository helps you deploy decoy resources (honeypots) across multiple cloud environments (GCP, AWS, Azure) using Terraform. The primary goal is to attract potential attackers, monitor their interactions, and alert you when suspicious activity is detected. This enables a proactive approach by allowing you to detect and respond to threats before they escalate.

## Introduction üöÄ

**Engodo** allows you to deploy decoy resources in GCP, AWS, and Azure to attract and monitor potential attackers. It is divided into three main modules, each module in this repository is designed to deploy and manage honeypots in a cloud-agnostic manner, making it easy to set up, monitor, and react to interactions across different cloud providers.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Multi-cloud support**: Deploy honeypots in GCP, AWS, and Azure.
- **Terraform-based**: Leverage Terraform for consistent infrastructure deployment.
- **Modular structure**: Separate modules for each cloud provider whilhe sharing most of the configuration.
- **Monitoring**: Watch logs and create events on interactions.
- **Ease of use**: Common setup variables across modules.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

**Engodo** is segmented into three modules, each dedicated to a specific cloud provider:

- `aws-mod`: AWS specific Terraform module
- `gcp-mod`: GCP specific Terraform module
- `azure-mod`: Azure specific Terraform module

Each module contains the necessary documentation and Terraform configuration files to deploy honeypots in the respective cloud environment. The modules share a common set of configuration variables to facilitate cross-cloud usage.

## Workflow üîÑ

1. **Setup Decoy**: Deploy honeypots resources in the cloud environment of your choice.
2. **Watch Decoy Logs**: Monitor logs generated by interactions with the honeypots resources.
3. **Create an Event**: Trigger an event when any interaction is detected
4. **Enrich Event**: Enrich the event with additional information and context, if possible.
5. **Alert**: Send an alert to the appropriate channels based on the event.

## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

The architecture of Engodo is designed to be modular and cloud-agnostic, allowing you to deploy honeypots in GCP, AWS, and Azure using a consistent configuration. The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of Engodo:

> Insert architecture diagram here

The architecture consists of the following components:

- **Terraform Configuration**: Contains the Terraform configuration files for deploying honeypots in GCP, AWS, and Azure.
- **Decoy Resources**: Honeypots deployed in the cloud environment to attract potential attackers.
- **Logging Services**: Cloud-native logging services to monitor interactions with the decoy resources.
- **Event Services**: Cloud-native event services to trigger events based on interactions with the decoy resources.
- **Alerting Services**: Services to send alerts based on the events triggered by interactions with the decoy resources.

The architecture is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing you to customize and enhance the functionality based on your requirements.

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with Engodo, you'll need to have Terraform installed and properly configured for your cloud environments. Follow the instructions below to set up and deploy your first decoy resource.

## Prerequisites üìã

- Terraform v1.0 or higher
- Accounts with sufficient permissions in GCP, AWS, and/or Azure
- Configured CLI tools for your cloud providers (gcloud, awscli, azcli)

<!-- ## Usage üìù -->

<!-- ### Setup Decoy

Watch Decoy Logs üìë
After deployment, you can monitor the logs of the deployed decoy resources using the logging services provided by the respective cloud providers:

AWS: CloudWatch
GCP: Stackdriver
Azure: Azure Monitor
Create Event on Interaction üîî
Configure your environment to trigger events based on interactions with the decoy resources. This can be done using the event services of the respective cloud providers:

AWS: CloudWatch Events or EventBridge
GCP: Pub/Sub or Cloud Functions
Azure: Event Grid or Azure Functions

## Common Configuration Variables üõ†Ô∏è

The following variables are common across all modules to facilitate cross-cloud usage:

- `resource_prefix`: A prefix for naming the resources.
- `topic_name`: Name of the Pub/Sub topic or SNS topic for sending alerts. if not specified, no alerts will be sent.
- `alert_email`: Email address for sending alerts. if not specified, no alerts will be sent.
For a complete list of variables, refer to the documentation of each module.
